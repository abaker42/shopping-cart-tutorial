## About Shopping-Cart Tutorial

The shopping-cart tutorial is an app that uses `react-redux` and `@reactjs/toolkit` to create an immersive shopping experience of where you can add items to a cart and have those items saved to a firebase backend. The items in the cart can be added or removed entirely from the cart modal.

### Advannce in the Shopping-Cart Tutorial

Currently you can only add and remove items here are some items that can progress the app forward if desired to enrich this app along with coding skill just create a branch and began working on an idea.

1. Have Items Pulled from Database. Currently items are hard coded it would be nice to pull items available from a database.

2. Add a checkout experience- If any real money is to be made from this app customers would have to check out and pay actual money. We would have to capture billing info and shipping info. There should a nodeJS solution we can code for this.

3. Add images to product display- Ok this product look and feel right now is just text based. An image of the product and maybe nice and a new product layout so it can be flexible for a few products or a large number of products.Pagination would be good depending on the number of products and filter ability.
